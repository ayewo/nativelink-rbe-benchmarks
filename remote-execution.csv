This was going out of its way to explicitly mark these as
ARM_AAPCS_VFP. This has been explicitly set since 8b40366b54bd4,
where the commit message states that sincos (not sincos_stret)
has a special calling convention. However, that commit also sets
the calling convention for all libcalls to ARM_AAPCS_VFP, and
getEffectiveCallingConv returns the same for CCC anyway in tests
using isWatchABI triples.

The net result of this appears to be a change in behavior when
using -float-abi=soft with isWatchABI, which have no tests so
I assume this is a theoretical combination.

If I assert

Only 2 tests fail the second condition, which look like copy paste
accidents
using v7k triples with linux and only needed a filler triple. This is a
consequence
of strangely using the target architecture in place of the OS ABI check,
